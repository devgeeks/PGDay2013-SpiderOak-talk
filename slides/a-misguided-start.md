#  A <x>Misguided</x> Start

Started out trying to pick a UI framework  

Wanted that native look on Android and iOS  

<p>&nbsp;</p>

KendoUI, ChocolateChipUI &amp; Bootstrap â€“ all had to be discarded for various reasons

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<section class="fragment">In the end, I chose jQTouch

<p>&nbsp;</p>

I believed I could just "skin" it when we got to other platforms</section>
